`DiagrammaticEquations.jl` is a Julia library implementing category-theoretic reasoning about systems of equations with diagrams. This package was extracted from [Decapodes.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl/) to decouple the representation of systems of equations from the solution of those equations. DiagrammaticEquations will grow to support many flavors of equations, starting with the Discrete Exterior Calculus equations from Decapodes.
